# Restaurant-Randomizer-CIT-336
This project was for a my CIT-336 class. Essentially my website can allow users to add restaurants to a database and then it will pick one for a user randomly and display it via google maps. Users can then like or dislike any of the restaurants giving them a rating. The idea is to help those who have trouble picking a place to eat maybe the randomizer can help find a new place for them!
